# Personal website

This is my personal website hosted by [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/). It is a simple repository for showing simple html/css implementations and serves as an index to my online profiles.

## Todo

- Update website icon to be rounded
- change from horizontal-split to vertical-split depending on page width
