# Personal website

This is my personal website hosted by [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/). It is a simple repository for showing simple html/css implementations and serves as an index to my online profiles.

## Todo

- Update website icon to be rounded
- change from horizontal-split to vertical-split depending on page width
- add animation on hover
- hello on same color as text (only change to orange on hover)
- select between dark and light mode
